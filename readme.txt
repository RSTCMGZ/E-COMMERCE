Hello everyone
Although this is my first html-css based e-commerce site project, its buttons and inputs are specially written.
It is written with separate components in accordance with the reaction structure with the logic of divide and conquer. 
It was a project that challenged and developed myself as much as possible.

If you want to watch it live, I leave the link below.
